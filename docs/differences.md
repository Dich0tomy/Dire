# Differences between this and other implementations

## How it started

This project started because I wanted a nice cross-platform way of discovering typical data directories.

The only feasible alternative I found is [`sago007/PlatformFolders`](https://github.com/sago007/PlatformFolders),
but it's unmaintained for two years now and doesn't necessarily expose the API I'd like to be using.

There's an awesome Rust crate [`dirs-dev/directories-rs`](https://github.com/dirs-dev/directories-rs) which very much
would fit my needs, but it's.. Rust, not C++ - so I wrote this.

## How it differs

TBD.

## Where it's going
